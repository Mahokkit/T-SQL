This is the SQL script I used to create a Casualty Star schema

I redid the ETL and used a staging Schema for my inital load.  I also used excel to modified the reference data spreadsheet, added AllLevel and rolled up the Casualty and Vehicle Type (the best I can) and used SSIS and load that into the staging schema.
